# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project is a Node.js command-line application.  Following a series of prompts, the app takes information about a theoretical team of employees and instantiates that information into a HTML.  There is also a folder of test scripts to ensure functionality.

I was motivated to create this project to show the benefits of a command-line appliation and how easily it can be incorporated in daily activities

## Installation

After opening the project, open the command-line terminal.  After running "node index.js", the user will be provided with a series of questions.  As the user answers the questions, the data will be used to construct a HTML.  Once the user has finished answering the questions, a complete HTML will be rendered in the "dist" folder.
